on homepage u can see the sidebar and navbar but as soon as u jump in the meeting there no sidebar nd navbar 
so w eneed sidebar nd navbar in hoempage just  not i meeeting page


see sidebar matters the most as we will do all the routing here only 
add sidebar links in a different file constants/index.ts and import this at sidebar 
this makes code cleaner exporting the arrays and importing it in sidebar
